# Due to an error in the `Funding.sol#requestWithdraw` function, legal `withdraw` fails.

## Summary
When setting the values of the `state` variable in the `Funding.sol#requestWithdraw` function, use `msg.sender` instead of `from`.
This will cause legitimate `withdraw`s to fail and cause other unusual problems.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `Funding.sol#requestWithdraw` function is as follows.

```solidity
     function requestWithdraw(
         Types.State storage state,
         address from,
         uint256 primaryAmount,
         uint256 secondaryAmount
     )
         external
     {
77: require(isWithdrawValid(state, msg.sender, from, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount), Errors.WITHDRAW_INVALID);
78: state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = primaryAmount;
79: state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = secondaryAmount;
80: state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] = block.timestamp + state.withdrawTimeLock;
         emit RequestWithdraw(msg.sender, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount, state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender]);
     }
```

As shown in `L78-L80`, set `state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw`, `state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw`, and `state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp` for the address of `msg.sender`.
However, in the `executeWithdraw` function, the values of `from` are obtained for the `state` variable in `L35~L95`.

The `Funding.sol#executeWithdraw` function is as follows.

```solidity
     function executeWithdraw(
         Types.State storage state,
         address from,
         address to,
         bool isInternal;
         bytes memory param
     )
         external
     {
93: require(state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[from] <= block.timestamp, Errors.WITHDRAW_PENDING);
94: uint256 primaryAmount = state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[from];
95: uint256 secondaryAmount = state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[from];
         require(isWithdrawValid(state, msg.sender, from, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount), Errors.WITHDRAW_INVALID);
         state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[from] = 0;
         state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[from] = 0;
         // No need to change withdrawExecutionTimestamp, because we set pending
         // withdraw amount to 0.
         _withdraw(state, msg.sender, from, to, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount, isInternal, param);
     }
```
If `from` is different from `msg.sender`, `withdraw` becomes impossible.

excuse:
1. `AliceOperator` calls the `requestWithdraw` function with `from = Alice`. Then, the values of `pendingPrimaryWithdraw[AliceOperator]`, `pendingSecondaryWithdraw[AliceOperator]`, and `withdrawExecutionTimestamp[AliceOperator]` are set.
2. After `withdrawTimeLock` passes, `AliceOperator` calls `executeWithdraw` function with `from = Alice`. Then, in `L93`, `withdrawExecutionTimestamp[Alice] = 0`, so the `executeWithdraw` function is reverted. As you can see on the right, the `executeWithdraw` function call fails. This is normal logic, but an attacker can use this logic to create other abnormal problems.
There may be other unusual examples as well.
## Impact
A legitimate `withdraw` may fail and cause many unusual problems.

## Recommendation
Modify the `Funding.sol#requestWithdraw` function as follows.
```solidity
     function requestWithdraw(
         Types.State storage state,
         address from,
         uint256 primaryAmount,
         uint256 secondaryAmount
     )
         external
     {
         require(isWithdrawValid(state, msg.sender, from, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount), Errors.WITHDRAW_INVALID);
- state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = primaryAmount;
- state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = secondaryAmount;
- state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] = block.timestamp + state.withdrawTimeLock;
- emit RequestWithdraw(msg.sender, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount, state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender]);
+ state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[from] = primaryAmount;
+ state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[from] = secondaryAmount;
+ state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[from] = block.timestamp + state.withdrawTimeLock;
+ emit RequestWithdraw(from, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount, state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[from]);
     }
```
