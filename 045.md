# Lack of validation for negative values in the `deposit` function within the `FundingRateArbitrage` contract

## Summary
The `deposit` function within the `FundingRateArbitrage` smart contract lacks validation to prevent negative `amount` values from being accepted as deposits. This oversight could potentially allow malicious actors to exploit the contract by providing negative values for `amount`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `deposit` function, the contract uses the following line of code to check if the `amount` is non-zero:

```solidity
require(amount != 0, "deposit amount is zero");
```

However, this code neglects to verify whether the `amount` is negative, which means that it does not prevent negative values from being used as deposits. As a result, a malicious user could submit a negative `amount`, and the existing `require` statement would not detect this, potentially leading to unintended and harmful outcomes.

## Impact
The absence of validation for negative `amount` values in the `deposit` function could have severe consequences, including but not limited to:

- Unauthorized withdrawal or manipulation of funds.
- Distorted account balances.
- Loss of user assets.
- Exploitation of contract vulnerabilities.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
    require(amount != 0, "deposit amount is zero"); // Potential vulnerability
    // Rest of the function logic...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is strongly advised to enhance the `deposit` function by explicitly verifying that the `amount` is both positive and non-zero. You can achieve this by modifying the function as follows:

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
    require(amount > 0, "deposit amount must be positive"); // Updated validation
    // Rest of the function logic...
}
```

By including the `amount > 0` check, you ensure that only positive and non-zero values are accepted as valid deposits, thereby reducing the risk of unintended behavior or exploitation of the contract.
