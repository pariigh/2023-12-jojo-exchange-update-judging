# Missing fallback oracle in OracleAdaptorWstETH

## Summary
Unlike the other oracle adaptors, OracleAdaptorWstETH.sol appears to be missing a fallback oracle to which price obtained should be compared against.
## Vulnerability Detail
From [JOJO Docs](https://about.jojo.exchange/jojo-1/trade/pricing#jojo-oracle-architecture), their oracle architecture was designed to use Chainlink as the primary oracle provider and with Uniswap V3 or JOJO self oracle as a fallback.

The two other oracle adaptors, OracleAdaptor.sol and UniswapPriceAdaptor.sol have a fallback oracle implemented, where price from Chainlink is compared against price from the fallback oracle. If the deviation exceeds a threshold, then price is rejected. 

```solidity
require((diff * 1e18) / chainLinkPrice <= priceThreshold, "deviation is too big");
```

For OracleAdaptorWstETH.sol however, there is no fallback oracle implemented and price is not checked against another source. This goes against JOJO's architecture as described in their docs, and checking price against reasonable limits is also advised by [Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits).
## Impact
In the event that Chainlink returns faulty price, it will be consumed by JOJO's contracts which could lead to negative outcomes such as unfair liquidations or attackers taking advantage of the inaccurate price.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Similar to the other oracle adaptors, implement a fallback oracle using Uniswap V3 or self-oracle and do a deviation check before returning the price feed.
