# User can circumvent withdrawTimeLock by using several accounts

## Summary
By using several accounts, user can do away with withdrawTimeLock

## Vulnerability Detail
`requestWithdraw` doesn't check for user actually having any funds. The user can, at any time, use several "pre-baked" EOAs/contracts and call `requestWithdraw` from `JOJODealer`/`JOJOExternal`/`Funding`, using uint256.max() `primaryAmount` and `secondaryAmount`. 
As there are no checks for actual user balance (only access checks), this will all pass and user can then deposit funds at convenient time after timelock expires and withdraw them whenever, thus circumventing withdrawTimeLock, which is clearly against design of the protocol.
