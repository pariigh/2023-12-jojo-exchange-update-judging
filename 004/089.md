# Incorrect `withdrawEarnUSDCAmount` is returned in function `FundingRateArbitrage.sol#requestWithdraw`

## Summary
An incorrect value `withdrawIndex` instead of `withdrawEarnUSDCAmount` is returned.
## Vulnerability Detail
Per the definition of the function `requestWithdraw()`. The `withdrawEarnUSDCAmount` should be returned.
```solidity
   function requestWithdraw(uint256 repayJUSDAmount) external returns (uint256 withdrawEarnUSDCAmount) {
//...
        withdrawEarnUSDCAmount = earnUSDCBalance[msg.sender] - lockedEarnUSDCAmount;
        withdrawalRequests.push(WithdrawalRequest(withdrawEarnUSDCAmount, msg.sender, false));
        require(
            withdrawEarnUSDCAmount.decimalMul(index) >= withdrawSettleFee, "Withdraw amount is smaller than settleFee"
        );
        earnUSDCBalance[msg.sender] = lockedEarnUSDCAmount;
        uint256 withdrawIndex = withdrawalRequests.length - 1;
        emit RequestWithdrawFromHedging(msg.sender, repayJUSDAmount, withdrawEarnUSDCAmount, withdrawIndex);
        return withdrawIndex;
```
However, at the end of the function, `withdrawIndex` is returned, which brings the inconsistency between the function definition and the return value.
## Impact
The incorrect value is returned, which may bring unexpected errors to front-end app.
