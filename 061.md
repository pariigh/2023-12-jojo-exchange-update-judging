# Checking whether account safe is not using correct rate on JUSDBank withdraw function

## Summary

JUSDBank's withdraw function is still using `getTRate()` instead of `accrueRate()` and `tRate`, which will impact the validity of `_isAccountSafe`

## Vulnerability Detail

the `getTRate` is still being used in some places, instead of the new `accrueRate()` and `tRate`.

This issue is related to previous audit's issue, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-judging/issues/73.`

```js
File: JUSDBank.sol
130:     function withdraw(
131:         address collateral,
132:         uint256 amount,
133:         address to,
134:         bool isInternal
135:     )
136:         external
137:         override
138:         nonReentrant
139:         nonFlashLoanReentrant
140:     {
141:         Types.UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
142:         _withdraw(amount, collateral, to, msg.sender, isInternal);
143:         uint256 tRate = getTRate();
144:         require(_isAccountSafe(user, tRate), Errors.AFTER_WITHDRAW_ACCOUNT_IS_NOT_SAFE);
145:     }
```

## Impact

Wrong `tRate` being used to check if a user's account is safe.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider to use `accrueRate()` and `tRate` on checking if an account is safe when withdrawing.

```js
  accrueRate();
  require(_isAccountSafe(user, tRate), Errors.AFTER_WITHDRAW_ACCOUNT_IS_NOT_SAFE);
```
