# using of solidity 0.8.20.

## Summary
This is because solidity 0.8.20 introduces the PUSH0 (0x5f) opcode which is only supported on the ETH mainnet and not on any other chains. That's why other chains can't find the PUSH0 (0x5f) opcode and throw this error. Consider using 0.8.19 for other chains. This should solve your problem.
