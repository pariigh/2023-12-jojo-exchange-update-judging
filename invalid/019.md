# Contract does not support deflation tokens

## Summary
This contract directly uses the input parameters entered by the user as the transfer amount and records it, without taking into account the deflation loss or transfer fees of some tokens during the transfer process.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `deposit()` functions use `safeTransferFrom()` to move funds from the sender to the recipient but fail to verify if the received token amount matches the transferred amount. This could pose an issue with fee-on-transfer tokens, where the post-transfer balance might be less than anticipated, leading to balance inconsistencies. There might be subsequent checks for a second transfer, but an attacker might exploit leftover funds (such as those accidentally sent by another user) to gain unjustified credit.

```solidity=37
    function deposit(Types.State storage state, uint256 primaryAmount, uint256 secondaryAmount, address to) external {
        if (primaryAmount > 0) {
            IERC20(state.primaryAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), primaryAmount);
            state.primaryCredit[to] += SafeCast.toInt256(primaryAmount);
        }
        if (secondaryAmount > 0) {
            IERC20(state.secondaryAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), secondaryAmount);
            state.secondaryCredit[to] += secondaryAmount;
        }
        emit Deposit(to, msg.sender, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A practical solution is to gauge the balance before and post-transfer and consider the differential as the transferred amount, instead of the predefined amount.
