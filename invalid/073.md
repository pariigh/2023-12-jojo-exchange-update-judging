# Missing nonReentrant Modifier in repayJUSD Function

## Summary
The repayJUSD function in the GeneralRepay.sol contract lacks the nonReentrant modifier, which could expose the contract to potential reentrancy attacks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The absence of the nonReentrant modifier allows an attacker to potentially execute malicious code repeatedly within the repayJUSD function before the previous execution completes, leading to unexpected behavior and potential exploitation.
## Impact
Assuming the GeneralRepay contract handles the repayJUSD function, allowing users to repay a certain amount of JUSD in exchange for another asset, e.g., ETH. Under normal circumstances, users can safely use this function to settle their debts.

**Reentrancy Attack:**

The attacker calls the repayJUSD function, simultaneously passing the amount of ETH to be returned (in the param parameter).
Before the function completes execution, the attacker re-enters the same repayJUSD function, possibly with a different target address (to) and a different amount of ETH.

Since the function is not protected against reentrancy, it executes again, leading to the reprocessing of the ETH transfer and JUSD return, potentially resulting in unpredictable outcomes.

**Potential Consequences:**

**Double Repayment:**

The attacker could leverage reentrancy to repay their debt multiple times in a single execution, leading to improper burden on the contract's financial system.

**Contract State Manipulation:**

By exploiting reentrancy, the attacker may attempt to manipulate the contract's state between different function executions, leading to inconsistencies in the contract's internal state.

**Fund Withdrawal:**

Through repeated calls, the attacker might attempt to withdraw more funds than intended, triggering additional operations within a single call.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add the nonReentrant modifier to the repayJUSD function to prevent potential reentrancy attacks. 
```solidity
contract GeneralRepay is Ownable {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

    // ... other variables ...

    // Non-reentrant modifier to guard against reentrancy attacks
    modifier nonReentrant() {
        require(!_reentrantGuard, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
        _reentrantGuard = true;
        _;
        _reentrantGuard = false;
    }

    function repayJUSD(address asset, uint256 amount, address to, bytes memory param) external nonReentrant {
        IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        // ... rest of the code ...
    }
}
```
