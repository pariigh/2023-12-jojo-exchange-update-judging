# Users can liquidate themselves

## Summary
Typically, in lending platforms or futures exchanges, some restrictions prevent users from liquidating themselves. That is the liquidator should be different from the borrower. Because liquidation often comes with a liquidation incentive, and in terms of reasonableness and fairness this shouldn't be given to the liquidated person.

More importantly, in the logic of some protocols,  if the liquidator and the borrower are the same in liquidation, there is a risk of data overwriting, leading to unforeseen consequences. For example, the borrower can redeem the collateral without repayment. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `liquidate()` function currently lacks restrictions preventing a trader from liquidating themselves.  To address this issue, the code logic needs to be revised. This can create an unfair advantage for the trader, which is not in the best interest of other participants.

making it impossible to track your actual position and determine your safe status.  As a result, L149 can be passed, allowing you to avoid liquidation.

1. The hacker participates in one perpetual. If the hacker wins money, it is fine.
2. When the hacker loses and meets the liquidation, he can liquidate himself and get his margin back without any payment.
3. Therefore hackers can keep making money by constantly moving positions and never lose money.
