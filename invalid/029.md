# `collateral` should approve `jusdBank` to 0 first because collateral can be USDT

## Summary
USDT needs approvals to be set to 0 first
## Vulnerability Detail
`collateral` can be USDT and the collateral doesn't approve `jusdBank` to 0 first before setting it to uint256.max
## Impact
since collateral doesn't set `jusdBank` to 0 first USDT is incompatible as a collateral.
