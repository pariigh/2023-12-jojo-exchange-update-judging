# front-runnable Fund allocation to Operators

## Summary
The `approveFundOperator()` function in Operation.sol set directly the approvals for `primaryCreditAllowed` and `secondaryCreditAllowed` to the amounts specified in the function parameters without any checks against the previous approvals. This lack of validation can lead to scenarios where an operator's approval can be escalated without proper tracking or limitation.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function approveFundOperator(Types.State storage state, address client,address operator,uint256 primaryAmount, uint256 secondaryAmount) external
{
    state.primaryCreditAllowed[client][operator] = primaryAmount;
    state.secondaryCreditAllowed[client][operator] = secondaryAmount;
    emit FundOperatorAllowedChange(client, operator, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount);
}
```
The vulnerability lies in the direct assignment of `primaryAmount` and `secondaryAmount` to `primaryCreditAllowed` and `secondaryCreditAllowed` respectively, without checking or comparing against the existing approved amounts.

### POC
1. Let's say Alice has an approval of 100 primaryCredit from Bob : `state.primaryCreditAllowed[Bob][Alice] = 100`
2. When she's approved 100 `primaryCredit` Alice directly uses Funding.sol#requestWithdraw(100) to create a request to withdraw 100 `primaryCredit` tokens that will be valid after `block.timestamp + state.withdrawTimeLock`
3. After some days, Bob wants to reduce `primaryCredit` allowed to Alice to 50
4. Alice frontrun Bob's call to `approveFundOperator()`, withdraw 100 `primaryCredit` token , `state.primaryCreditAllowed[Bob][Alice]` is decreased to `0`
5. Bob's call to `approveFundOperator()` is executed, then Alice has 50 new `primaryToken` to use as she wants.

## Impact
An approved operator becoming malicious may be able to use/withdraw more tokens than intended

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of setting the given amount, sponsor can reduce from the current allowed funds, checking by the way whether the previous allowance is spend or not.
