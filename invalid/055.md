# Fee skirting in FundingRateArbitrage

## Summary

Deposit fees can potentially be avoided in FundingRateArbitrage, especially for the first depositor

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's say you are the first depositor into the FundingRateArbitrage contract and you want to deposit `X` tokens. Instead of depositing `X`, just deposit an extremely small amount at first (say 1 token) and pay little to no fees. As the first depositor, you now have all the `earnUSDC` (representing shares of the total value), so just manually send a bunch of `USDC` into the contract now. You won't lose out when you withdraw, as the USDC you sent in will be part of the `getNetValue()` calculation. This just avoids the deposit fee.
