# User can DDOS withdrawal of funds for other user

## Summary
User can DDOS withdrawal of funds for other user by abusing invalid check in `isWithdrawValid` in `Funding`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`isWithdrawValid` in `Funding` performs access check to allow `requestWithdraw` only for user or address that has `state.primaryCreditAllowed[from][spender]`. 

However the actual check is: 
`state.primaryCreditAllowed[from][spender] >= primaryAmount` and `state.secondaryCreditAllowed[from][spender] >= secondaryAmount`. 

The `requestWithdraw` itself will work with 0 `primaryAmount` and  `secondaryAmount` inputs, but will still increment `withdrawExecutionTimestamp`. 

Thus attacker can abuse this checks to lock the user out of withdrawing funds by repeatedly calling `requestWithdraw`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either check >= check to > check or don't increment `withdrawExecutionTimestamp` if `primaryAmount` and `secondaryAmount` are zero
