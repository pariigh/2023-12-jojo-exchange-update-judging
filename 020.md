# approveTarget may not == swapTarget

## Summary
approveTarget may not == swapTarget for some DEXES, this may cause issues with approval as the DepositStableCoinToDealer.sol contract only approves approveTarget for swaps. 

In a situation where approveTarget != swapTarget, swapTarget isnt approved to do swaps in DepositStableCoinToDealer.depositStableCoin()

## Vulnerability Detail
see summary.

An example of such dexes that approveTarget may not == swapTarget is DODO. There could still be some other ones too.


## Impact
In a situation where approveTarget != swapTarget, swapTarget isn't approved to do swaps in DepositStableCoinToDealer.depositStableCoin()

The DepositStableCoinToDealer.depositStableCoin() function may revert due to lack of approval.
