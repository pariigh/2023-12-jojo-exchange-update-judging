# Users can still avoid to be liquidated

## Summary

in cases where `liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC != 0` the user can still avoid being liquidated even if this finding has been highlighted in the last contest, sponsor didn't changed how 

## Vulnerability Detail
Since the liquidate function has a requirement that checks if the remaining USDC has been transferred to the user who is being liquidated, this user can exploit this and cause them to be added to the USDC blacklist to avoid being liquidated.
```solidity
function liquidate(...)
{
        // ... CODE ... //
        _afterLiquidateOperation(afterOperationParam, amount, collateral, liquidated, liquidateData);

        require(
            JUSDBorrowedT0 - userInfo[liquidated].t0BorrowBalance >= liquidateData.actualLiquidatedT0,
            Errors.REPAY_AMOUNT_NOT_ENOUGH
        );
        require(
            IERC20(primaryAsset).balanceOf(insurance) - primaryInsuranceAmount >= liquidateData.insuranceFee,
            Errors.INSURANCE_AMOUNT_NOT_ENOUGH
        );
        require(
            IERC20(primaryAsset).balanceOf(address(this)) - primaryLiquidatedAmount
                >= liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC,
            Errors.LIQUIDATED_AMOUNT_NOT_ENOUGH
        );
        IERC20(primaryAsset).safeTransfer(liquidated, liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC);
        // ... CODE ... //
}
```

## Impact

The liquidation process might DoS due to its reliance on paying back remaining tokens in USDC only. This will error where transferring USDC tokens to blacklisted users can cause the transaction to be reverted, disrupting the liquidation flow. This will result in a bad debt for the platform.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Skip the repayment for USDC Blacklisted users or create a new mapping and withdraw function for storing liquidated USDC that has to be claimed by liquidated users
