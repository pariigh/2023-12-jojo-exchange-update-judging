# Discrepancy between accrueRate and getTRate in `JUSDBankStorage` leads to issues

## Summary

There is a fundamental discrepancy between `accrueRate` and `getTRate` in `JUSDBankStorage` that causes some problems. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the code for `accrueRate`:

```solidity

    function accrueRate() public {
        uint256 currentTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        if (currentTimestamp == lastUpdateTimestamp) {
            return;
        }
        uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
        tRate = tRate.decimalMul(
            (timeDifference * borrowFeeRate) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR + 1e18
        );
        lastUpdateTimestamp = currentTimestamp;
    }

```

And here is the code for `getTRate`:

```solidity
    function getTRate() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
        return
            tRate + (borrowFeeRate * timeDifference) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR;
    }
```

They are very similar, but notice how `getTRate` adds onto the current interest rate (using the `+` operator), while `accrueRate` is multiplicative (which is likely the correct way to go about doing it).

This means that the result of `getTRate` will be consistently a bit lower than `accrueRate`. This causes issues with `withdraw`. Because `withdraw` doesn't call `accrueRate` but rather uses `getTRate`, the interest rate used will be a little lower than what it should be. This means that the user will be able to withdraw a little more than they should be able to, since the interest rate from `getTRate()` will be a bit lower:

(Code from withdraw function in `JUSDBank`)

```solidity
uint256 tRate = getTRate();
require(_isAccountSafe(user, tRate), Errors.AFTER_WITHDRAW_ACCOUNT_IS_NOT_SAFE);
```

The account will indeed be safe here because of the lower tRate. However, at the same time, after this withdraw, the account may also be liquidatable, because `liquidate` uses `accrueRate` which will use the higher interest rate. This clearly implies that the user has been able to withdraw more than they really should be able to. 

## Impact

User will be able to withdraw a bit more than they should be able to
