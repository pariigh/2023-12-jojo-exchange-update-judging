# `tRate` was calculated incorrectly in the `JUSDBankStorage.sol#accrueRate` function.

## Summary
In the `JUSDBankStorage.sol#accrueRate` function, the `tRate` value is calculated large. This causes users to lose `JUSD` when calling the `JUSDBank.sil#repay` function or the `JUSDBank.sol#liquidate` function that uses the `accrueRate` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `JUSDBankStorage.sol#accrueRate` function is as follows.

```solidity
     function accrueRate() public {
             uint256 currentTimestamp = block.timestamp;
             if (currentTimestamp == lastUpdateTimestamp) {
                 return;
             }
             uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
59: tRate = tRate.decimalMul((timeDifference * borrowFeeRate) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR + 1e18);
             lastUpdateTimestamp = currentTimestamp;
     }
```

The `JUSDBankStorage.sol#getTRate` function is as follows.

```solidity
     function getTRate() public view returns (uint256) {
65: uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
         return tRate + (borrowFeeRate * timeDifference) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR;
     }
```

The calculation formula for `tRate` in `59` is as follows.

```solidity
     tRate = tRate.decimalMul((timeDifference * borrowFeeRate) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR + 1e18) = tRate * (timeDifference * borrowFeeRate) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR / 1e18 + tRate * 1e18 / 1e18 = tRate + tRate * (timeDifference *borrowFeeRate) / Types .SECONDS_PER_YEAR / 1e18
```

The calculation formula for `tRate` in `L65` is as follows.

```solidity
     tRate + (borrowFeeRate * timeDifference) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR
```

However, the initial value of `tRate` is 1e18 (`JUSDBank.sol#L39`), and this value continues to increase, so the difference between `L65` and `L59` becomes larger.
The correct calculation formula for `tRate` is `L65`. The reason is that `borrowFeeRate` is the increase in `tRate` over a one-year period.
## Impact
When users call the `JUSDBank.sol#repay` function or the `JUSDBank.sol#liquidate` function, they lose `JUSD`. This loss continues to increase as `tRate` increases.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `JUSDBankStorage.sol#accrueRate` function as follows.
```solidity
     function accrueRate() public {
         uint256 currentTimestamp = block.timestamp;
         if (currentTimestamp == lastUpdateTimestamp) {
             return;
         }
- uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
- tRate = tRate.decimalMul((timeDifference * borrowFeeRate) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR + 1e18);
+ tRate = getTRate();
         lastUpdateTimestamp = currentTimestamp;
     }
```
