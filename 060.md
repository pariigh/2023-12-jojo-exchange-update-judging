# Gas Limit

## Summary
Gas Limit: There is no check on the number of calls being made in a single multiCall invocation. If too many calls are included, the transaction could run out of gas, causing it to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
 for (uint256 i; i < callData.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory res) = address(this).delegatecall(callData[i]);
            if (success == false) {
                assembly {
                    let ptr := mload(0x40)
                    let size := returndatasize()
                    returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)
                    revert(ptr, size)
                }
            }
            returnData[i] = res;
        }
    }


## Impact
 If too many calls are included, the transaction could run out of gas, causing it to fail.
