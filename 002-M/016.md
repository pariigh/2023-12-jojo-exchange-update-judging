# Rate calculation inconsistency inside JUSDBankStorage

## Summary
JUSDBankStorage has 2 functions that are used to calculated current borrow rate and they do calculations in different way.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/JUSDBankStorage.sol#L53-L66
```solidity
    function accrueRate() public {
        uint256 currentTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        if (currentTimestamp == lastUpdateTimestamp) {
            return;
        }
        uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
        tRate = tRate.decimalMul((timeDifference * borrowFeeRate) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR + 1e18);
        lastUpdateTimestamp = currentTimestamp;
    }

    function getTRate() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
        return tRate + (borrowFeeRate * timeDifference) / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR;
    }
```

`tRate` is borrow rate and function `accrueRate` calculates it as 
`tRate = tRate * (timeDifference * borrowFeeRate / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR + 1)`
and `getTRate` function calculates it as `tRate = tRate + timeDifference * borrowFeeRate / Types.SECONDS_PER_YEAR`

Both these functions should provide same result of `tRate`, but as you can see it is not like that.

Because of that, different `tRate` will be used by another parts of protocol. For example borrow balance will use [getTRate function result](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/JUSDView.sol#L68), while `repay` will use rate [after `accrueRate` is called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/JUSDBank.sol#L125). So when user will calculate amount that he needs to repay, then amount can be calculated using `getTRate`, and when he will be repaying, then tRate will be updated using `accrueRate` which will lead to another borrow amount.
## Impact
tRate is calculated differently in different part of protocol.
