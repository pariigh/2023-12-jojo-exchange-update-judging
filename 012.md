# FundingRateArbitrage allows users to avoid loss

## Summary
FundingRateArbitrage allows users to avoid loss as they can just simply not withdraw and keep jusd.
## Vulnerability Detail
Users [provide usdc into FundingRateArbitrage contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/FundingRateArbitrage.sol#L266). Then contract [deposits same amount of jusd](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/FundingRateArbitrage.sol#L267) to user's account and user can withdraw those funds and use them.

USDC that were provided by users are going to be swapped to eth, then used to borrow jusd in the bank and then use jusd to participate in perp trading. The aim of FundingRateArbitrage is to earn additional funds from pepr markets and increase index price, which means that user's will be able to get more funds then they have deposited.

As FundingRateArbitrage will hold some positions in perp market, then it's possible that they will loose some funds(because of price change) and they can even be liquidated, which makes it possible to index price become less than 1. Such case signals that FundingRateArbitrage contract faced a loss and not users who will `requestWithdraw` will receive smaller amount of usdc.

However in this finding i want to flag, that in case if such thing will happen, then user will not call `requestWithdraw` anymore, because it means that they will need to burn bigger amount of jusd for smaller amount of usdc. All user will likely hold jusd or swap it on some market and get better price.

This will mean pure loss of jusd for the protocol as those jusd was covered by usdc.
So currently user can be sure that they will not lose funds with FundingRateArbitrage contract.
## Impact
Loss is not distributed among depositors.

## Recommendation
I would redesign this contract to be similar to erc4626 vault that mints own tokens and do not deposit jusd for users.
