# Funds could be stolen from DepositStableCoinToDealer, FlashLoanLiquidate, FlashLoanRepay, GeneralRepay contracts by passing crafted ERC20 asset

## Summary

Funds could be stolen from DepositStableCoinToDealer, FlashLoanLiquidate, FlashLoanRepay, GeneralRepay contracts by passing crafted ERC20 `asset` in [depositStableCoin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/DepositStableCoinToDealer.sol#L33), [JOJOFlashLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/FlashLoanLiquidate.sol#L46), [JOJOFlashLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/FlashLoanRepay.sol#L36C14-L36C27), [repayJUSD](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/GeneralRepay.sol#L33) methods. These methods doesn't check for `asset` and transfer funds to arbitrary address `to`.  

## Vulnerability Detail

Funds could be stolen from DepositStableCoinToDealer, FlashLoanLiquidate, FlashLoanRepay, GeneralRepay contracts by passing crafted ERC20 `asset` in [depositStableCoin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/DepositStableCoinToDealer.sol#L33), [JOJOFlashLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/FlashLoanLiquidate.sol#L46), [JOJOFlashLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/FlashLoanRepay.sol#L36C14-L36C27), [repayJUSD](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/GeneralRepay.sol#L33) methods. 

These methods doesn't have any checks for `asset`, which could be specifially crafred to pass all the other checks. Any calls to passed address (as `IERC20(asset).<method>`) could be easilly manipulated, call to `swapTarget.call(data)` could be mainpulated too, considering the `data` variable is arbitary and also isn't checked. The project code and documentation doesn't really specify what kind of `approveTarget` and `swapTarget` could be whitelisted. Considering the `data` being passed to those addreses is arbitrary, it's higly possible these calls can be manipulated and attacked too. 

All these methods are external and transfer funds to specified `to` address at the end, which is also arbitrary. Passing all the specified above checks, it allows to steal all the funds from contract. 

## Impact

Funds from specified contracts could be stolen.

## Recommendation

Check passed `asset`, `param` and `to` params by whitelist or more sophisticated mechnism.
