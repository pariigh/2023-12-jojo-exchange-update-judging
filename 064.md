# `pendingPrimaryWithdraw`, `pendingSecondaryWithdraw` is not cleared out on `_withdraw` resulting user can have instant withdrawal when `fastWithdraw` is disabled

`pendingPrimaryWithdraw`, `pendingSecondaryWithdraw` is not cleared out on `_withdraw` resulting user can have instant withdrawal when `fastWithdraw` is disabled

## Summary

`pendingPrimaryWithdraw`, `pendingSecondaryWithdraw` should be cleared out on `_withdraw` in case of user perform a `requestWithdraw` while the `fastWithdraw` is enabled to withdraw their asset.

## Vulnerability Detail

Normally, withdrawing will require a certain delay or timelock, but if `fastWithdraw` is active, user can withdraw directly without need to wait withdraw timelock expired.

The issue here is that, when `fastWithdraw` is enabled but user do `requestWithdraw`,  `withdrawExecutionTimestamp` is not cleared. Thus if the `fastWithdraw` is disabled later, user can execute the next withdrawal without any timelock.

This also makes, `pendingPrimaryWithdraw` and `pendingSecondaryWithdraw` are not cleared when user actually execute `fastWithdraw`.

those variables `pendingPrimaryWithdraw`, `pendingSecondaryWithdraw` and `withdrawExecutionTimestamp` should be cleared when the `_withdrawal` executed. Currently only by calling `executeWithdraw` the `pendingPrimaryWithdraw` and `pendingSecondaryWithdraw` are cleared to 0.

```js
File: Funding.sol
69:     function requestWithdraw(
70:         Types.State storage state,
71:         address from,
72:         uint256 primaryAmount,
73:         uint256 secondaryAmount
74:     )
75:         external
76:     {
...
78:         state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = primaryAmount;
79:         state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = secondaryAmount;
80:         state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] = block.timestamp + state.withdrawTimeLock;
...
82:     }
084:     function executeWithdraw(
085:         Types.State storage state,
086:         address from,
087:         address to,
088:         bool isInternal,
089:         bytes memory param
090:     )
091:         external
092:     {
...
097:         state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[from] = 0;
098:         state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[from] = 0;
099:         // No need to change withdrawExecutionTimestamp, because we set pending
100:         // withdraw amount to 0.
101:         _withdraw(state, msg.sender, from, to, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount, isInternal, param);
102:     }
```

Even though this seems not important or part of user mistakes, but this can potentially skip the timeout with this case:

1. user request withdrawal, pendingPrimaryWithdraw and pendingSecondaryWithdraw are not zero
2. before user executing executeWithdrawal, the protocol activate fastWithdrawal
3. user withdraw their asset (via fastWithdrawal), but pendingPrimaryWithdraw and pendingSecondaryWithdraw are still not zero
4. next time if protocol decided to disable fastWithdrawal, user still have an active `pendingPrimaryWithdraw` and `pendingSecondaryWithdraw`, and guarantee to instant executeWithdrawal

Also, the state of user will be wrong, for example executing `executeWithdrawPrimaryAsset` on `DegenSubaccount` will not be valid since it will fetch `getCreditOf` which is out of state. 

```js
File: DegenSubaccount.sol
92:     function executeWithdrawPrimaryAsset(address to, bool toInternal) external onlyOwner {
93:         (uint256 maxWithdrawValue, uint256 pendingPrimaryWithdraw) = getMaxWithdrawAmount(address(this));
94:         require(pendingPrimaryWithdraw <= maxWithdrawValue, "withdraw amount is too big");
95:         IDealer(dealer).executeWithdraw(address(this), to, toInternal, "");
96:     }

File: JOJOView.sol
40:     function getCreditOf(address trader)
41:         external
42:         view
43:         returns (
44:             int256 primaryCredit,
45:             uint256 secondaryCredit,
46:             uint256 pendingPrimaryWithdraw,
47:             uint256 pendingSecondaryWithdraw,
48:             uint256 executionTimestamp
49:         )
50:     {
51:         primaryCredit = state.primaryCredit[trader];
52:         secondaryCredit = state.secondaryCredit[trader];
53:         pendingPrimaryWithdraw = state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[trader];
54:         pendingSecondaryWithdraw = state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[trader];
55:         executionTimestamp = state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[trader];
56:     }
```

## Impact

unsynced state between `primaryCredit` and `pendingPrimaryWithdraw`, and also user can execute instant withdrawal even though the fastWithdrawal is disabled
