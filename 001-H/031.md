# Unsafe `call` allows an arbitrary user to steal all funds within JOJODealer

## Summary
Unsafe `call` allows an arbitrary user to steal all funds within JOJODealer

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `withdraw` function, if the user passes `data`, the contract tries to call the the specified `to` address with the provided data. 
```solidity
        if (param.length != 0) {
            require(Address.isContract(to), "target is not a contract");
            (bool success,) = to.call(param);
            if (success == false) {
                assembly {
                    let ptr := mload(0x40)
                    let size := returndatasize()
                    returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)
                    revert(ptr, size)
                }
            }
```
A user can simply specify the `to` address as the ERC20 contract with `transfer` method and steal all funds within the contract. 
The user can do the same with the `transferFrom` to steal all outstanding allowances the users might have towards the contract.

## Impact
Completely draining the contract + user allowances
