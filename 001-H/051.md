# Arbitrary call in Funding#_withdraw can be used to drain all contract balances

## Summary

The final portion of Funding#_withdraw allows a user to make an arbitrary call to the `to` address. By transferring to the token contracts, a malicious user can call `transfer` or `transferFrom` and steal contract balances/allowances.

## Vulnerability Detail

[Funding.sol#L173-L184](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/libraries/Funding.sol#L173-L184)

    if (param.length != 0) {
        require(Address.isContract(to), "target is not a contract");
        (bool success,) = to.call(param);
        if (success == false) {
            assembly {
                let ptr := mload(0x40)
                let size := returndatasize()
                returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)
                revert(ptr, size)
            }
        }
    }

`Funding#_withdraw` allows making an arbitrary contract call with the param passed in by the user. By transferring to either the `USDC` or `JUSD` contract they can uses this call to access the `transfer` or `transferFrom` methods. This allows the user to directly send all contract balances where ever they choose. It also allows stealing of any approvals made to the contract.

## Impact

Malicious user can steal all balances and allowances

## Recommendation

Don't allow users to access the param argument for normal withdraws. Restrict this to only fastWithdraw whitelisted contracts.
