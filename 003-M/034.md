# First depositor issue in `FundingRateArbitrage`

## Summary
An attacker might steal an innocent user's deposit within `FundingRateArbitrage` 

## Vulnerability Detail
Upon depositing into the contract, the user specifies how much `USDC` they want to deposit. Then, the amount is divided by the current `index` and this is effectively the user's 'shares' (`earnUSDCAmount`). 

```solidity
        uint256 earnUSDCAmount = amount.decimalDiv(getIndex());
        IERC20(usdc).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        JOJODealer(jojoDealer).deposit(0, amount, msg.sender);
        earnUSDCBalance[msg.sender] += earnUSDCAmount;
```

An attacker can basically do the common ERC4626 first depositor attack and steal the first depositor's assets 
 - Deposit 1 wei and mint 1 share
 - Wait for innocent user's deposit (e.g. for 1e18) 
 - Front-run it and donate 1e18 to the contract, making the price per share `1e18 + 1`
 - Innocent user's shares get rounded down to 0.
 - Attacker can then withdraw all funds and repeat the attack. 

## Impact
Steal first depositor's assets
