# Share price manipulation by first depositor in FundingRateArbitrage

## Summary
First depositor in FundingRateArbitrage can increased share price in order to make next depositors loss funds in favor to attacker.
## Vulnerability Detail
First depositor in FundingRateArbitrage contract will get index as [e18](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/FundingRateArbitrage.sol#L100). This means that he can provide 1 unit of usdc and [make `totalEarnUSDCBalance` to be 1 as well](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/FundingRateArbitrage.sol#L270). 

When `totalEarnUSDCBalance != 0`, then `getNetValue` function is called to calculate funds controlled by contract. Then this amount is divided by all shares, to get index.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/FundingRateArbitrage.sol#L87-L95
```solidity
    function getNetValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 jusdBorrowed = IJUSDBank(jusdBank).getBorrowBalance(address(this));
        uint256 collateralAmount = IJUSDBank(jusdBank).getDepositBalance(collateral, address(this));
        uint256 usdcBuffer = IERC20(usdc).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 collateralPrice = IJUSDBank(jusdBank).getCollateralPrice(collateral);
        (int256 perpNetValue,,,) = JOJODealer(jojoDealer).getTraderRisk(address(this));
        return
            SafeCast.toUint256(perpNetValue) + collateralAmount.decimalMul(collateralPrice) + usdcBuffer - jusdBorrowed;
    }
```
There are different ways for attacker to donate funds to the FundingRateArbitrage contract and one of them is just to send usdc directly.

In case if attacker will donate big amount of funds to the FundingRateArbitrage, then he will increase the index price.
And when next depositor will call `deposit`, then because if large index price, he [can get 0 `earnUSDCAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-jojo-exchange-update/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/src/FundingRateArbitrage.sol#L265). After that `totalEarnUSDCBalance` do not change, but `getNetValue` increases, which means that index price has increased and attacker has gained profit.
## Impact
Attacker can earn profit by increasing share price.

Make sure first depositor does not small deposit.
