# Index Devaluation Lockout in Liquidity Withdrawals

## Summary
The `getIndex()` function calculates the ratio between `netValue` and `totalEarnUSDCBalance`. If this index continually decreases (which might happen if the arbitrage strategy consistently underperforms or if there are other factors decreasing the netValue), the value of each LP's stake in terms of USDC decreases correspondingly and due to the `require`statement in `requestWithdraw()` users won't be able to withdraw their deposit

## Vulnerability Detail
The line `require(earnUSDCBalance[msg.sender] >= lockedEarnUSDCAmount, "lockedEarnUSDCAmount is bigger than earnUSDCBalance")` acts as a safeguard to ensure that LPs can only withdraw what they are entitled to based on the current index.

However, in a scenario where the index continually decreases (if not enough LPs or bad conditions) , the `lockedEarnUSDCAmount` (calculated as `jusdOutside[msg.sender].decimalDiv(index))` for each LP would increase because it takes more `earnUSDCBalance` units to represent the same amount of underlying USDC due to the lowered index.

This situation would effectively lock their funds, preventing them from withdrawing the USDC amount they originally deposited, as their `earnUSDCBalance` doesnâ€™t suffice to cover the withdrawal request due to the devalued index.

## Impact
No possibility for LPs to withdraw their funds, even with decremented value

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a function to let LPs withdraw their funds even in bad conditions where they lose a part of their money
